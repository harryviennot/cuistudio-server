**Title**: Griddled Lamb Chops with Chunky Salsa
**Description**: A fantastic meal featuring tender lamb chops served with a fresh and chunky salsa.
**Tokens**: 27860 | **Cost**: $0.0551 | **Time**: 23.23s

**Servings**: 2 | **Difficulty**: medium
**Prep**: 10 min | **Cook**: 15 min | **Total**: 25 min

#### Ingredients
- 0.5 pieces fresh red chili (to taste)

**For the salsa**
- 2 large ripe tomatoes
- 1 pieces red pepper
- 1 bunch fresh basil
- 4 pieces lamb chops (depending on size)
- olive oil (for cooking)
- sea salt (to taste)
- black pepper (freshly ground, to taste)
- extra virgin olive oil (for salsa)
- splash red wine vinegar (to taste)

#### Instructions

**For the salsa**
1. **Prepare Your Chops and Salsa**: Put a griddle pan on a high heat and let it get screaming hot. Halve your chili (deseed it if you want to avoid heat). Cut your tomatoes in half. Halve and deseed your pepper, then cut each into strips. Pick the basil leaves off the stalks and put them to one side. Drizzle both sides of your chops with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. _(~5 min)_
2. **Cook Your Chops and Salsa**: Stand your chops upright in the hot pan so that the fatty edges are directly on the heat for about 1 minute until brown and crispy. Lay the chops flat in the pan and push them down gently for a minute or so. Add your chilies, pepper, and tomatoes – cut side down. Cook your chops for about 4 to 5 minutes in total, turning them every minute or so and pushing the meat down each time. _(~5 min)_
3. **Finish Cooking and Prepare Salsa**: When the vegetables have softened and are nice and charred, transfer them to a chopping board. When the veg are golden and crisp, put them on a plate to rest for a minute or two while you prepare your salsa. Chop the chilies, tomatoes, pepper, and basil leaves until you get a nice chunky consistency. Put them into a bowl with a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Add a little splash of red wine vinegar and stir in well. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. _(~10 min)_
4. **Serve Your Chops and Salsa**: Serve your chops on a bed of your lovely hot chunky salsa. Finish by scattering the reserved basil leaves on top. _(~5 min)_
